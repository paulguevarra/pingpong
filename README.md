## Description

_This web application takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 1 to the chosen number with the following exceptions:_

* _Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "ping"_
* _Numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "pong"_
* _Numbers divisible by 15 are replaced with "ping-pong"_

_A user should be able to enter a new number and see new results over and over again._

_This project should satisfy the following objectives:_
* _JavaScript business logic and user interface logic are separate._

* _Variable names are descriptive and use lower camel case (e.g. myVariableExample)._

* _Code has proper indentation and spacing._

* _Application implements a for loop and works as expected._

* _All previous objectives have been met._

* _Logic is broken down into "plain English" specs, listed in README._

* _Project is in a presentable, portfolio-quality state._

* _Required functionality is in place by Friday deadline._

* _Project demonstrates understanding of this week's concepts. If prompted, you are able to discuss your code with an instructor using correct terminology._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

## Specs "it can..."

* _Program will output a number sequence range from 1 to a chosen number_
  _Input = "17"_
  _Output = "1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17"_
* _Program can identify all numbers in the sequence that is divisible by 3 and replace it with "ping"_
  _Input = "1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,..."_
  _Output = "1,2,ping,4,5,ping,7,8,ping,10,11,ping,13,..."_
* _Program can identify all numbers in the resulting sequence that is divisible by 5 and replace it with "pong"_
